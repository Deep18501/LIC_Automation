I developed this automation script to simplify and streamline my father's work. 
He was frequently performing repetitive tasks that involved performing a series of steps for a large number of entries. 
To save time and effort, I decided to automate the process using Python and the Selenium library.

The script automates the process of logging into a specific website, entering login credentials, filling in a captcha, 
and navigating through various pages to perform specific actions. 
Additionally, it reads data from an Excel spreadsheet containing a list of entries, 
extracts relevant information, and dynamically enters it into the web form.

By automating these repetitive tasks, my father can now focus on more important aspects of his work, 
while the script efficiently handles the monotonous tasks. It has significantly increased productivity and reduced the chances of human error.

This project not only showcases my programming skills but also demonstrates my ability to identify and address real-life challenges by leveraging automation.
It highlights my commitment to simplifying processes and finding innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and productivity.
